Perfect — let’s lay out those 12 recursion problems in a **step‑by‑step roadmap** so you can practice them in increasing difficulty without feeling overwhelmed.

## 🚀 Recursion Practice Roadmap (Easy → Hard)

### **Level 1: Foundations (Easy)**
1. Print numbers from 1 to N without using loops  
2. Factorial of a number using recursion  
3. Reverse a string using recursion  
4. Check if an array is sorted using recursion  

👉 These build your comfort with the *basic recursive structure* (base case + recursive call).

---

### **Level 2: Core Applications (Medium)**
5. Fibonacci number (nth term) using recursion  
6. Sum of digits of a number using recursion  
7. Recursive bubble sort or insertion sort (pick one)  
8. Palindromic partitions of a string  

👉 These strengthen your ability to apply recursion to *mathematical problems and string manipulations*.

---

### **Level 3: Advanced Problem-Solving (Hard)**
9. Rat in a Maze problem (find all paths)  
10. Word Search (backtracking with recursion)  
11. N-Queens problem  
12. Sudoku Solver  

👉 These are classic *backtracking problems* where recursion explores multiple paths and constraints.

💡 **Tip for practice:**  
- Do **Level 1 in one sitting** (they’re short).  
- Spend more time on **Level 2**, especially string problems.  
- For **Level 3**, tackle one at a time — they’re bigger projects that test your patience and debugging skills.  

Would you like me to also give you a **hint/approach outline for each problem** so you don’t get stuck while practicing?
